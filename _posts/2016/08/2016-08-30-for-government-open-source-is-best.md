If you've been paying attention to open source news this month, you already know that [Bulgaria recently passed a law requiring the government to use open-source software](https://thepolicy.us/bulgaria-got-a-law-requiring-open-source-98bf626cf70a#.f9angczfq). What you might not know is what the law actually means in practice, and how it might affect the open source community in other parts of the world.

In short, the law requires all software written for the government to be open-source and to be developed as such in a public repository (one that will probably mirror GitHub).

The law comes in the form of several amendments to the country's Electronic Governance Act, and includes the creation of an agency that will supervise the software. [You can read the text here](https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?act=url&depth=1&hl=en&ie=UTF8&prev=_t&rurl=translate.google.com&sl=bg&tl=en&u=http://lex.bg/laws/ldoc/2135555445&usg=ALkJrhj6bRM1QDcQhcjlNtkkx_ZnBwhhHA).

### Why Bulgaria is Going (Officially) Open-Source

The reported logic behind this new law is that since the public pays for any software developed for government, that software should also be visible and accessible to them.

Also, the relative inaccessibility of government software to the public that is the norm doesn't protect very well against attack. Vulnerabilities in government software get exploited pretty frequently, partly because contracts with developers run out and then problems arise and nobody fixes them - leaving a hole that can be exploited by a hacker.

With open source, the public can help maintain security, security issues will be identified more readily, and bounties can be set for finding them so they can be fixed.

### What the Law Will Mean for Bulgaria

It's important to understand that this doesn't mean the government will be run entirely on open source software from now on.

What it means is that specifically government-commissioned software will be open source from now on. So basically, any existing license agreements will stay intact, and the government can still use a turnkey solution if they decide that it makes sense. Also, security and intelligence agencies are not subject to the law.

But that isn't to downplay the importance of the move. The legislation is already having an impact, as it was reported earlier this month that three software projects at pre-tender stage have received open-source requirements for moving forward. It's also been said that there will be a bug-bounty program.

### Will It Spread?

While the legislation seems radical, it's not really. There's plenty of government data already available or being made available for the public to see and use, for many of the same reasons, and governments are aware (and becoming ever more aware) of the security benefits of open source software.

What Bulgaria has done is formalize this, and in so doing helping the raise the profile and understanding of open source - which we're all for.

Hopefully this will mean that more governments take similar steps, and at the same time everyone can learn from Bulgaria's mistakes (and Bulgaria's wins) regarding open source. All good things.
