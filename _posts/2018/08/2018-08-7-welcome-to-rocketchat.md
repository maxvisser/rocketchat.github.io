After Slack announced its acquisition and discontinuation of Atlassian HipChat and Stride, HipChat users have voiced  their concerns regarding the lack of self-hosted options for team chat and collaboration, as well as some security concerns linked to Cloud versus on-prem options.

This Migration Bundle includes:
- Import assistance for HipChat Data Center users (a built-in feature in Rocket.Chat)
- Discount on Rocket.Chat for early adopters of our Enterprise Bundle offer (includes Enterprise and Tech Support)
